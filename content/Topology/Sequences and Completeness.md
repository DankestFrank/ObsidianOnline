Fractal geometry is interested in the classification of subspaces of metric spaces. An example of a subspace of a metric space $(\mathbb{R^2},d_{Euclidian})$ is all the points $x\in \mathbb{R^2}$ such that $d((0,0),x)<1$; this would be the filled in open disk subspace. While most metric spaces are "simple" in character, some subspaces can be very complicated, depending on the rule that defines it.
