Hello, I am Frank Dininno. I am a math enthusiast, but more importantly, I am simply curious about a variety of life's subjects. You will see a lot of different, seemingly unrelated, fields here, but they all play a vital role in engineering. In my mind, to create something, one must know their physics, chemistry, simulations, mathematics, and fabrication devices. Here, I explore these topics out of love, but also with the intention of creating something meaningful. Enjoy,
- Frank Dininno
