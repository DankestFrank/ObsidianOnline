The keystone of geometric algebra is that any number of vectors can be multiplied associatively and distributively together. The one rule about this geometric product is that a vector multiplied by itself must produce a scalar and that scalars commute with everything.

The result is that the dot product and wedge product can be constructed between two multivectors, which are products of an arbitrary number of vectors, via the geometric product. The wedge product of two multivectors is defined to be the highest dimensional element of their geometric product while the dot product is defined to be the lowest non-zero element of their geometric product.

This space of multivectors is
