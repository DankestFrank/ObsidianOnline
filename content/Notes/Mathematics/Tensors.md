Tensors are essentially a way to take two or more vector spaces, irrespective of their elements, and turn them into a tensor vector space. A tensor vector space is a vector space where the bases are tensor products of the basis vectors in the original vector space. For example, if we have three vector spaces $X,H,E$ with bases vectors $[x_{1},x_{2}], [h_{1}], [e_{1},e_{2},e_{3}]$, then one such tensor basis would be $x_{1} \otimes h_{1} \otimes e_{2}$
