Here, $g(x,y)=c$ represents a constraint. That is, the variables $x,y$ must be points that satisfy the equation above.

The gradient of $g$ would give you the change in $c$ if it were to move in that direction.

There are points on the curve traced out by $g$ whose tangent space is the same as a level curve on $F$. At these points, $g$ has therefore reached a maximum because movement along level curves result in zero increase in $c$.

# The Gradient
The gradient is the generalization of the derivative to geometric objects with more than one dimension. 
Given a smooth, open domain of dimension $r$, and a parameterization, $f$, onto the smooth, open domain,  $V$ (which is the geometric object).



, which takes $U \to V$, where both $U$ and $V$ are open sets of the same dimension
