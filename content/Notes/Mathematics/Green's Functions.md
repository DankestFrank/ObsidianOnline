This blog does it justice if you know that functions are elements of infinite dimensional vector spaces whose basis vectors are spaced $dx$ apart. Think of it this way: for each value of $x$, there is a basis vector associated with that $x$. The coordinate at that basis vector is the value of your function at that $x$ value. The coordinates are spaced $dx$ apart because we assume that the only x values that we consider are spaced $dx$ apart. What you are left with is a vector $f = [f(x_{1}), f[(x_{2})], f(x_{3}), \dots]$ where $x_{1},x_{2},$ and $x_{3}$ are spaced $dx$ apart. 

To take the dot product, you have to do integration
