To view the Maxwell Equation, the units of the fields must first be understood.

We know by experiment the formula for the electric field. $\epsilon$ appears in the denominator. When we follow Gauss' Law and integrate the field around the sphere encapsulating the charge, we get that the integral equals $\frac{q}{\epsilon}$. This implies that out of all the constants in the electric field formula, $\epsilon$ is of relevance. In fact, because it appears in the denominator, we call it the permittivity of free space, because it reduces the strength of the field.

If we multiply both sides of the Gauss Equation by $\epsilon$ then we get the integrand to be $\epsilon \mathcal{E}$. Therefore $\epsilon \mathcal{E} \cdot ds = dq$  means that $\epsilon \mathcal{E}$ represents the electric field per unit area. Remember, $\mathcal{E}=\hat{R}\frac{1}{4\pi R^2} \frac{1}{\epsilon} \left[ \frac{V}{m} \right]$ so $\epsilon$ in a way turns charge per unit area at a point into field/voltage change at a point.

$\mathcal{D}=\epsilon\mathcal{E} \left[ \frac{C}{m^2} \right]$
$\mathcal{B}=u\mathcal{H} \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]$

represent Coloumbs per meter squared and Webers per meter squared respectively (one Tesla). 

On the other hand 

$\mathcal{E} \left[ \frac{V}{m} \right]$
$\mathcal{H} \left[ \frac{A}{m} \right]$

represent Volts per meter and Amperes per meter.

We then have 

$p \left[ \frac{C}{m^3} \right]$ 
$p_{m} \left[ \frac{W}{m^3} \right]$

represent Coloumbs per meter cubed and Webers per meter cubed.

And finally we have
