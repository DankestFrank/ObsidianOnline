To view the Maxwell Equation, the units of the fields must first be understood.

We know by experiment the formula for the electric field. $\epsilon$ appears in the denominator. When we follow Gauss' Law and integrate the field around the sphere encapsulating the charge, we get that the integral equals $\frac{q}{$\epsilon$}$
