Entropy was defined by Boltzmann to be$$S=k_{b}\ln(\Omega)$$'Where $\Omega$ is the number of microstates of the system and $k_{b}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Essentially, a system's current entropy is given by the number of microstates available. In a completely isolated system, the entropy cannot change. 

Entropy is defined for systems in equilibrium because dynamical systems do not have a well defined set of microstates.

Entropy is temperature dependent, admittedly giving it a sort of $\frac{states}{time}$ vibe. $\Delta S=\frac{1}{T}Q$ which says that if heat is lost from a high temperature system, teh
