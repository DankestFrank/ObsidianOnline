Entropy was defined by Boltzmann to be$$S=k_{b}\ln(\Omega)$$'Where $\Omega$ is the number of microstates of the system and $k_{b}$ is the Boltzmann constant. Essentially, a system's current entropy is given by the number of microstates available. In a completely isolated system, the entropy cannot change. 

Entropy is defined for systems in equilibrium because dynamical systems do not have a well defined set of microstates.

Entropy is temperature dependent, admittedly giving it a sort of $\frac{states}{time}$ vibe. $\Delta S=\frac{1}{T}Q$ which says that if heat is lost from a high temperature system, then the entropy does not change that much.

**$S$ should be viewed as the ability for the ambient temperature to do work on the system** and add energy to it while dispersing it at the same time. The reason for this is statistical; by chance, there may be high energy density due to the environmental temperature that could evaporate a water molecule and cause it to fly away from the bulk, never to return. The water molecule has gained energy, but it has been dispersed. In equilibrium, the number of micr
