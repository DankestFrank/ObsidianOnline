$HC_{l}$ dissociates in water because $C_{l}$ has a much higher electron affinity than Hydrogen. This causes a large dipole moment, large enough that the lone pair of electrons from an oxygen orbital can start to pull off a proton, and the rest of the polar water molecules can "salt out" the resulting fields from the charge imbalances.

This is all favorable because it transforms two polar molecules into two non-polar molecules. The orbital geometry of the water molecule causes it to be polar, but making it a hydronium ion balances out the previous asymmetry of the formal charges. Hydrochloric acid was once polar, but with the removal of the hydrogen, it is now non-polar. The sea of water molecules makes it possible for the ionic charge imbalances within the solution to exist, by aligning, successively, their dipoles against the fields to neutralize the
