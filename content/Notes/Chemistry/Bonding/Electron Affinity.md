Knowing what was said about the [[Repulsion Within Atoms|limits of electrons]] existing within the atom, there is still some room for more electrons within an atom, exceeding the atomic number. The position of these extra electrons will have their own electron cloud and the repulsion this extra electron experiences will depend on the average position of its orbital within the atom. In the case of a lone hydrogen atom, an extra electron is not stable because its orbital would be the same 1s orbital as the first electron, meaning that it would experience equal repulsion and attraction everywhere, making the total attraction about zero. It would not stick then because it does not portion the volume to allow for both electrons to attract, it is a battle to the death in this case over which one stays. If the extra electron raised its energy level so that it did not overlap with the 1s orbital, it would still be exiled because the 1s orbital is spherically symmetric, effectively blocking the charge of the nucleus everywhere, so the extra electron would still feel no pull.

At times, one of two atoms sharing electrons will pull more heavily on an electron just due to the nature of the orbital formation which stems from the respective fields. How heavily an atom pulls on an electron with respect to how heavily hydrogen pulls on an electron is called an atom's electron affinity.
