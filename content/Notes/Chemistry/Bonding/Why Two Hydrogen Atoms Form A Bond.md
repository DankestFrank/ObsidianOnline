Although I realized this at the same time that I started reading the article, hydrogens are neutral only far away from each other. The fields of each proton have an effect on the shape of the electron wavefunctions as each atoms approaches one another (so we will not see what happened to the [[Electron Affinity|lone hydrogen]]). In this case, it is good to think of each atom as a positive charge attached to a negative charge. In equilibrium, the lowest energy state would be like 2x2 matrix with electrons on the diagonals and protons on the off diagonals, thereby lowering their total energies. Like one of the posters in the forum said, each electron experiences two forces of attraction and one force of repulsion.
