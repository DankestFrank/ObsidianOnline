The LCAO works because electrons are Fermions, meaning that they can interfere because they are interchangeable particles. Specifically, their wavefunctions anticommute when their positions are swapped because they are Fermions. ~This is my hypothesis from what I know. Confirmation still awaits and I would like to talk to a quantum chemist.
