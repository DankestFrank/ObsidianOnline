Acidity mainly comes down to electronegativity and the size of the atom.

If the atom is large, then the hydrogen which is attached to it is really easy to steal away because the atom's electrons hold onto it more loosely (they are spread out in space more) and they can be polarized away from the hydrogen more easily by an incoming base.

If the atom is very electronegative then it shifts the electron wave function away from the hydrogen and toward its own nucleus. Now, the electrons which surrounded the hydrogen and which repelled away the incoming bases are no longer there, and the electrons are easier to polarize away from the hydrogen toward the oxygen by an incoming base, allowing the base to steal the hydrogen. In short, it reduces the electron density around the hydrogen.
