I do not know where emotions come from.

I would conclude that they came from evolution, if I knew that evolution was the root cause of all life. But even this I do not know for sure. I have not tested it myself, and I only hold it to be my only learned explanation of the fossil records and the history of life, with inadequate study on my part, because that is what was taught in school - not self-discovered.

But even if this was the root cause of emotions, and if there was a root cause whatsoever from any source, this would not change what I have to say about emotions.

Whether emotions came from evolution or not. Whether they serve so that I will have sex and bond tightly to another person or not. Whether emotions are a means to an end, such as a child, or not, they are nonetheless at times present as a part of our consciousness. These emotions may recur often in a similar feeling, likely because their activation comes from stable structures in our brain, which do not change much, no matter how many times we experience the emotions they create (other than maturing and traumatic events). But saying this now, feels wrong, pointless. To say that the feelings have no meaningful goal it defeating to hear. 

To read that it is a possibility that emotions serve no purpose and do not serve to bind parents to children is harrowing.
