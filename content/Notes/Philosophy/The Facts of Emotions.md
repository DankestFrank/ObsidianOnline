I do not know where emotions come from.

I would conclude that they came from evolution, if I knew that evolution was the root cause of all life. But even this I do not know for sure. I have not tested it myself, and I only hold it to be my only learned explanation of the fossil records and the history of life, with inadequate study on my part, because that is what was taught in school - not self-discovered.

But even if this was the root cause of emotions, and if there was a root cause whatsoever from any source, this would not change what I have to say about emotions.

Whether emotions came from evolution or not. Whether they serve so that I will have sex and bond tightly to another person or not. Whether emotions are a means to an end, such as a child, or not, they are nonetheless at times present as a part of our consciousness. These emotions may recur often in a similar feeling, likely because their activation comes from stable structures in our brain, which do not change much, no matter how many times we experience the emotions they create (other than maturing and traumatic events). But saying this now, feels wrong, pointless. To say that the feelings have no meaningful goal it defeating to hear. 

To read that it is a possibility that emotions serve no purpose and do not serve to bind parents to children is harrowing. Yet, as I have said before, sensational experiences, including those of emotions, are independent of the physical circumstances which activate them. To elaborate, there is no objective morality. A machine can be built to experience whatever emotion or color based on any physical circumstance they sense because it must be true that emotions and other experiences follow physical rules.

Therefore, because we do not know absolutely for sure why we are built the way we are, we can not know for sure why our emotions exist, as they are a result of our physical bodily and brain structures.

To say that we feel love for a baby as being "good" has no self-evident meaning. To say that a creature in pain is bad also has no self-evident meaning, other than in reference to our own emotions. In a way, then, we are like robots, programmed to feel emotions according to the circumstance we find ourselves in, no matter how many times it happens over again. 

What drives me every day, is to bring joy and stop the sadness in the world. I find it right because I am programmed that way. Other people find it right because they are programmed that way. In simpler terms, sadness results in actions,  urges, or more emotions to oppose the situation; in the case of happiness, the opposite. But an alien may not see it this way.
