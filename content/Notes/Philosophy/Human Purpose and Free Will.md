It is not hard to conclude "I have to purpose" because you do not see the clear purpose in life. Indeed, it is difficult to know this question, when we barely know the origins of life or the root of our universe's laws. 

However, it is only that "We do not know our purpose" that we must conclude, which is much more freeing. Indeed, it may be the case that we do not have a purpose at all, or that the purpose that was meant for us is something we reject. 

In this case, we are allowed to create our own purpose, as a purpose is a logical thought, and we are the thought and the thought is us. 

This gives us free will. Unlike emotions and sensations, which we cannot help but experience, logical thought is within our minds, and we do control it. Controlling it means controlling ourselves, our actions too. However, logical thought controls us as much as we control it because we are one and the same.

Again, logical thought follows rules, mysterious as it is. This means that, like emotion, the universe determines what we ultimately think. However, this time, we are one with what the universe wills for us, rather than only the receiver of what the universe will, which is the case of emotions and other sensations.
