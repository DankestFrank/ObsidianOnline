I do not know where emotions come from.

I would conclude that they came from evolution, if I knew that evolution was the root cause of all life. But even this I do not know for sure. I have not tested it myself, and I only hold it to be my only learned explanation of the fossil records and the history of life, with inadequate study on my part, because that is what was taught in my schools - not self-discovered.

But even if this was the root cause of emotions, and if there was a root cause whatsoever from any source, this would not change what I have to say about emotions.

Whether emotions came from evolution or not. Whether they serve so that I will have sex and bond tightly to another person or not. Whether emotions are a means to an end, such as a child, or not, they are nonetheless at times present as a part of our consciousness. These emotions may recur often in a similar feeling, likely because their activation comes from stable structures in our brain, which do not change much, no matter how many times we experience the emotions they create (other than maturing and traumatic events). But saying this now, feels wrong, pointless. To say that the feelings have no meaningful goal it defeating to hear. 

To read that it is a possibility that emotions serve no purpose and do not serve to bind parents to children is harrowing. Yet, as I have said before, sensational experiences, including those of emotions, are independent of the physical circumstances which activate them. To elaborate, there is no objective morality. A machine can be built to experience whatever emotion or color based on any physical circumstance they sense because it must be true that emotions and other experiences follow physical rules.

Therefore, because we do not know absolutely for sure why we are built the way we are, we can not know for sure why our emotions exist, as they are a result of our physical bodily and brain structures.

To say that we feel love for a baby as being "good" has no self-evident meaning. To say that a creature in pain is bad also has no self-evident meaning, other than in reference to our own emotions. In a way, then, we are like robots, programmed to feel emotions according to the circumstance we find ourselves in, no matter how many times it happens over again. 

What drives me every day, is to bring joy and stop the sadness in the world. I find it right because I am programmed that way. Other people find it right because they are programmed that way. In simpler terms, sadness results in actions,  urges, or more emotions to oppose the situation; in the case of happiness, the opposite. But an alien may not see it this way.

Logically, people are always driven to either go towards happiness or to end their sadness, however that may be.

So, the reason is simpler than we think. We want to be happy simply because we just want to be. It is how we are. How the emotion comes about physically is more complicated. 

Furthermore, emotions are a sort of shared unity, shared consciousness among many animals - a unity. We understand what pain and sorrow feel like, we all think it is wrong, and we all know the signs of it. But in the end, the degree of empathy an animal has can still vary, and the correctness of such empathy is unsure. This is more evident when we realize that what emotions another animal experiences are usually unknown to us. We only know their emotions by how similar we believe they are programmed to us, and usually only be obvious responses like exclamations. This is why mood is so important when it comes to mating, at least with humans. A woman actually cannot know what is in your mind, yet she must know still via other methods. This is an evolutionary limitation coming to show.

Language is another imperfect beast. It may not be completely entwined with emotion, but it is still a way to transfer a bit of one's consciousness to another. At a moment, one's consciousness is the language, the language is the sound, the sound becomes the language again in someone else's mind, but the language in their mind may mean something else. Only sentences full of logic can completely transfer over. Sentences invoking experiences will almost definitely vary.

Lastly, I would like to say that emotions are governed by logic, but they are also the embodiment of certain types of logic. Fear, is the embodiment to act to prevent. Beauty is the logic to become at one with what is sensed. Why they were assembled in our brain to trigger at certain times is unclear, just as unclear as why or how we are all here.
