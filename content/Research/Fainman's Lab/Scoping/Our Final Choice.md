On the 13th of August, I, Andrew, and Professor Fainman decided to run with ElmerFEM
My first mission is to get elementary models working.
This includes 2D mode solving, 3D mode solving, and possibly waveguides.
After this, the other graduate students would help out or give input to my work. I would then be tasked with writing up a tutorial for new students and or coding custom solvers from scratch to accomplish our needs.
