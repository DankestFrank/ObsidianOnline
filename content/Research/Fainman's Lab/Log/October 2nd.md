Right now, it is October 2nd, 12:08 a.m.

For the past two hours, I have taught myself with the help of chatgpt-4o how to compile c-files from a tar-gz file, the significance of compiling, and the significance of the /usr and /usr/bin directories within the file system. All this experience came from deal.ii failing to run from an `apt` install, requiring me to build deal.ii from its source code.

At this moment, I debate whether it is better to have the new students use ElmerFEM or deal.ii.
On one hand, ElmerFEM is much easier to use, but just like me, in the real world, they will inevitably run into a problem which is not solvable by ElmerFEM and will require custom programming. Inevitably, down the simulation road, they must learn how to use Linux, compile files, and code using C++, just as I have had to in the past few months.

I therefore believe it is a service to teach these students how to dual boot and compile files, given that these are essential skills for any simulator, and
