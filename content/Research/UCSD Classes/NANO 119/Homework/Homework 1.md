1-25 Complaints About UCSD
1. I do not have enough room in off-campus housing to store all of the food that I cook in containers
	1. Buy tupperware.
2. My off campus dining food doesn't taste like anything
	1. Add seasoning and olive oil.
3. I don't know whether this girl I met in dance class has chemistry with me.
	1. Go on more dates with her.
4. It seems like my current UCSD schedule will barely accommodate all of the things I want to do.
	1. Give up part of your life. In this case, I choose sleep.
5. The elevator light to the HSS does not work.
	1. Take the stairs
6. The textbooks they recommend at this school are so terrible (other than ECE).
	1. Get ChatGPT's opinion instead
7. It seems like you can't sit down in a single cozy place on this campus (excluding the one I am at right now)
	1. Put on some music on your earbuds so you can ignore your other senses and get your work done.
8. Rimac seems to be too far away from everywhere important and there are too many people there.
	1. Go to the outdoor gym
9. It seems like every time I go to the outdoor gym, there are gym classes going on, so they won't let me in
	1. Check the outdoor gym schedule
10. It seems like they class schedules align precisely with when they get off class.
	1. It's time to do pullups and pushups with a backpack on.
11.  The administration is trying to screw the nanoengineering department over by cutting funding and restricting class sizes.
	1. Make the classes more rigorous and take on more ambitions projects. When news coverage comes, expose the administration for their transgressions.
12. Freshman and Sophomores have no  friends
	1. The school should encourage Sororities and Fraternities (and the sailing team).
13. The school is too divided over the Israel Palestine conflict.
14. 

1-13
1. Control over the nanoscale is governed by top-down processes, excluding DNA programming.
	1. Develop voltage controlled molecular structures.
2. My knowledge of chemical reactions is not good enough to bind nanoparticles to surfaces.
	1. Take the CHEM 41 series.
3. There are no airtags thin enough to be slapped onto my earbud charging case. 
	1. Create a flexible silicone chip and sell it for money, and then forget about worrying about your earbuds because you are so wealthy.
4. Light cannot be sorted efficiently for the use of solar panels
	1. Use GRIN lenses to sort the light into different wavelengths
5. The electrical power grid is too inefficient due to power generation and large losses in transportation
	1. Localize energy sources via thin film solar panels
6. Progress in nanoengineering is too slow because we are only focusing on materials which were theorized several decades ago.
	1. We must explore new materials rather than optimizing old ones.
7. Complicated structures, biology excluded, are too difficult to create using our current methods.
	1. We need true nanofactories rather than trying to use current methods in more novel ways.
8. Current nano-theraputics uses nanoparticles in conjunction with external light sources
	1. We need true nanorobots which can controlled to identify and kill diseases.
9. The current nanoengineering department doesn't even teach chemistry. This produces incompetent nanoengineers.
	1. They NEED to teach chemistry or REQUIRE us to take chemistry classes. Ask any student if they know the chemical reactions necessary to coat gold nanoparticles onto a primed surface.
10. The nanoengineering department barely has any nanomanufacturing classes. Just ask any student if they are capable of manufacturing any of the newest devices, they will say NO. The produces VERY incompetent nanoengineers.
	1. The nanoengineering department should require labs to be inserted into the curricula of almost all nanoengineering courses. Furthermore,
