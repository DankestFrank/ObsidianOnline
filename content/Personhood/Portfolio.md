Hello, I am Frank Dininno. 
$\quad$I am a math enthusiast, but I am also curious about a variety of life's subjects. You will see a lot of seemingly unrelated fields here, but they all play a vital role in engineering. In my mind, to create something, one must know their physics, chemistry, simulations, mathematics, and fabrication devices. Here, I explore these topics out of love, but with the intention of creating something meaningful. To a good day,
 - Frank Dininno
