Why is suffering a bad thing? At times, there seems to be no conclusion to this question. At times, it seems like there is nothing wrong with suffering, but I think there is a reason why I think it is wrong.

When you see a beautiful palace from a fairyland, you adore it, you want to see it and admire it for all its beauty and glory. Why would you want to destroy it? Would you want to see it burn? No.

The same is true for a little bird who is chirping in pain or fear. We see that understand that it struggling to survive when we sense fear and pain. But, we humans are natural creationists. We want to see life thrive, life flourish. We want to see the world become a better place, grow, be green all around.

We are not destructionists. We were born out of creation.

I think this is sacred, holy.
