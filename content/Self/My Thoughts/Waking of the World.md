The universe struggles with itself through animate beings like ourselves.
It is trying to wave up, to see what is right and what is wrong, to find its own morality through living conscious matter. 
One day, the entire universe will wake up, conscious matter almost everywhere.
The struggle we have right now will determine what the future of morality in the universe is.
We are like neurons in a brain, each one competing on which is the right one to fire, influencing the end result of our persona.
Struggle now, struggle hard, and at times use force, for this religious zeal will be the determiner of what the universe believes will be right in the end.

Another conundrum this is: to enact one's will or remain harmonious? But harmony is a two way street. Harmony means that the without is in phase with within and within is in phase with without. Although one's powers are small, they still have influence on the without, sometimes one person more than others. It could be me if I pay attention.
