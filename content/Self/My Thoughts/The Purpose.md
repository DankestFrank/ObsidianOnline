I do have depression. I do severely hinder myself when I am going to do an assignment because I am overcome by a feeling of pointlessness to it - so pointless that it is striking.

What mostly makes me feel better is seeing the large picture of all things which I am looking at. It brings clarity. To see a car, and know exactly why it was made - for the person to drive. To see a building and know why it was made - for people to live and work. These simplify life a lot, and it allows me to comprehend all of society, but not its little details.

Now I am caught in a conundrum. I can either see the point of all things and accept them and feel better about myself or reject all of it. In this case, I have no incentive to change anything in society - I understand society and I will let society do its thing because I understand it and I am comfortable with it. On the other hand, if I reject it, then I see all of the wicked parts of our world like human trafficking, torture, abuse, cruelty, and I feel too small to solve any of them. I feel so small, that if I aim at a small problem and solve it, my existence is still unrecognized. 

That is conundrum which I am stuck in - see with clarity and stay passive or blind myself in ignorance and forever be starved of fame or recognition.

There is a thin middle-ground that I must walk, as thin as a line in a plane. Either way I step, and I will fall off, unsure of whether I will return to where I was before. It is like a narrow bridge in a jungle or an animal trail in a plane.

It is necessary that I always see with clarity, as this was necessary for my ancestors living in the wild, and will be so for me.

There was once a saying that I saw written in the billboards of school, likely the saying of indigenous people.
"
A fool fights with the ocean.
Wise folk dance with the rising waters.
"
But does to dance with the rising waters mean to remain passive, to go along with the atrocities that might arise? I think the answer is yes, and I think the indigenous people are right. One must dance with the rising waters because if they fight they against it they are doomed for failure. To dance with the waters means to gain power with the water. Only when the time is right, only when you have danced long enough, will you have the capability to change what is wrong. It is the only way. One must dance with the rising waters. One must plan.

Now, I must see with clarity, and dance with the waters, not remaining passive, but moving smoothly with the slow river
