I do have depression. I do severely hinder myself when I am going to do an assignment because I am overcome by a feeling of pointlessness to it - so pointless that it is striking.

What mostly makes me feel better is seeing the large picture of all things. It brings clarity. To see a car, and know exactly why it was made - for the person to drive. To see a building and know why it was made - for people to live and work. These simplify life a lot, and it allows me to comprehend all of society, but not its little details.

Now I am caught in a conundrum. I can either see the point of all things and accept them and feel better about myself or reject all of it. If I accept, then I have no incentive to change anything in society - I understand society and I will let society do its thing because I am comfortable with it. On the other hand, if I reject it, then I see all of the wicked parts of our world like human trafficking, torture, abuse, cruelty, and I feel too small to solve any of them. I feel so small, that if I aim at a any problem and solve it, my existence is still unrecognized. 

That is conundrum in which I am stuck - to see with clarity and stay passive or to blind myself in ignorance and forever be starved of fame or recognition.

There is a thin middle-ground that I must walk, as thin as a line in a plane. Either way I step, I will fall off, unsure of whether I will return to where I was before. It is like a narrow bridge in a jungle or an animal trail in a field.

It is necessary that I always see with clarity, as this was necessary for my ancestors living in the wild, and will be so for me.

There was once a saying that I saw written in the billboards of school, likely the saying of indigenous people.
"
A fool fights with the ocean.
Wise folk dance with the rising waters.
"

Does dancing with the rising waters mean to go along with the atrocities that might arise? 

I believe the answer is "affirmative" because the alternative is to be submerged. Only when one has danced long enough with the waters does he or she have a chance to change the currents. It is the only way.

Now, I must see with clarity, and dance with the waters, not remaining passive, but moving smoothly with the slow river.

Recognizing this may be hard. To recognize such a thing is to recognize the great force around you, and the relatively little force you carry. One must choose harmony, over recognition. Such a thing is hard, such a thing is ego death. Does one accept their own death and still remain alive? Does one choose harmony and eternal loneliness at the same time?

One's only hope for both is how biology wills it. 

I only hope to dance with a woman in the waters.
