A difficult question to swallow: "is wanting love selfish?"

I admittedly say "yes"

But, I also say that when you are in love, you are equally unselfish as you are selfish, as your wants are to satisfy their wants. To satisfy their pleasure.

This is what connection is; to give and receive, to be at one with your desires'.

There is nothing wrong with this, this is a form of unity, one of the purest forces in the whole universe. Be at love, be at one, and always be patient, for time is a deep place as long as you remain in it, yet also so mortal we are.
